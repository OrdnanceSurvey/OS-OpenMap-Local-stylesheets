**9.**  Double-click on a layer to access the ‘Layer Properties’ window > select the ‘Source tab’ > click on ‘Set Data Source…’ > navigate to your OS Open Map Local data > select the data that matches the layer for example, Text = Building.shp > select ‘Add’

Repeat step 7 for all layers.

We recommend viewing the map between **1:2,500** and **1:10,000** for maximum legibility

Your map should now look similar to this:
